# M8 Worker Quality Report and UML Sequence Diagram
## Design
Now we will create sequence diagrams for the application. Go back to your analysis diagrams and use cases created earlier, and make them into UML sequence diagrams. This is an individual requirement (as always, you do not have to cover for your team mates). Each person should make a sequence diagram that covers their use case and illustrates the dynamic interactions between objects in the design.

## Implementation
We will now add the ability of the worker to submit a quality report. Ensure that those with only user privilege cannot submit a report.

## Requirements
Have a way to navigate to the water quality report screen
Ensure only workers/managers can access report screen
Ensure screen requests all required information
Cancel screen should not save data
Save should record report in the model
Manager should be able to view the list of quality reports
