# M7 Google Map Display and UML Class Diagram
## Design
Create the UML class diagram for the complete application. You do not need to show constructors, getters or setters in the methods. You do not need to show private methods or attributes which are for implementation only. This diagram should focus on your model classes. You do not need to model the UI screens, since these were covered in the earlier milestone (UI prototypes).

## Implementation
You should now implement the water availability screen. This screen should display a Map (you can use any api you wish, although google maps is pretty well documented.). The map should have markers at each location that water has been reported. Clicking on the pin should provide information from the water report.

PERSISTENCE IS NOT YET REQUIRED, SO IT IS OK TO HAVE TO ENTER USERS AND REPORTS BEFORE SHOWING THE MAP.

## Demo Requirements

Show that previous functionality still works.

Provide a way to navigate to the water availability screen.

Display a map


Place pins at the locations of each report

Show report details for a pin when it is selected by the user
